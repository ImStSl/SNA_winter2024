I'm Brian Barczyk, and I have been daily vlogging on YouTube since May 10, 2016 sharing my amazing life filled with animals. My journey here on YouTube and social media has been truly magnificent and magical. Since 2016, I've been part of TV network series, produced my own documentary in South Africa, traveled the world to meet incredible animals and animal lovers, started a podcast, created a convention for animal content creators, built and expanded The Reptarium - an interactive reptile Zoo in Utica, Michigan and so much more. In March 2023, just as we were ready to break ground on our expanded facility, I received a life-altering diagnosis of inoperable Pancreatic Cancer. Despite the challenges and my fears, the amazing community we've built on YouTube over the last 7+ years has kept me inspired to continue sharing my journey.Now, I'm fully committed to building our expanded facility, Legasea Aquarium & The Reptarium, just across the street. This project represents resilience and the pursuit of dreams in difficult times. With the incredible support of our community, the #ReptileArmy, we're turning obstacles into opportunities. Together, let's create a brighter future for reptiles and all animals, inspiring others to embrace their passions in the face of adversity.Join us on this inspiring journey of discovery, conservation, and hope. Together, we'll make a lasting impact and celebrate the extraordinary animal world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This week I am starting on a project that I have been thinking about for quite some time. I want to create a whole new universe of original characters. Some of these characters will be based on characters of mine that I've already done, and some will be brand new. I am really invested in the idea, so I hope you guys enjoy. In this video, I focus on making the 2 part mold out of silicone and using casting material to create my base character that I will then sculpt onto with air dry clay and finally paint! The painting comes next week, so don't forget to come back next Friday. VIDEO TUTORIAL I USED: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuIqpiQ1000___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh) Elizabeth and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 29 and like doing creative activities (mostly painting on things), or really anything that gives me an excuse to use rainbows, sprinkles and my own cutesy characters in excess. I'm heavy into editing, so my video are chalk full of sound effects, filters and lil....moments, or as we like to call them MEmes. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and various other items I find. I also love to draw, traditionally and digitally. I'm not the most skilled artist out here, but I like to focus on having fun with creativity and being able to laugh at my own mistakes.

Taken at face value, one might hear that sentence and imagine the Cold War took the combatants by surprise, how could friends so quickly become enemies, after all? But the great irony was that not only was the Cold War not a surprise, but both sides knew it was coming. Even when they had been allies. The Cold War was as pure of a war of ideologies as one could get, not a war of armies and weapons, but one of influence and power. The United States sought to align the world with their capitalist economic model while the Soviets put their effort into reinforcing the communist model, this clash of economic ideologies led to a lot of tension, amplified by the fact that if one side was pushed too hard, nukes would follow. That possibility made this war one of the scariest, even though no shots were fired. For as Albert Einstein is often quoted to have said, I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.Works Consulted / Read More: I had way too many to put into a video description, I put my sources in this google dog here if you are curious: https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSKjmMDHuAPoF88CzfMJEOcAxmNe3hQRLOj4cMzm5YYY9tYUy6g86KYTeVXecuZyzPqghSjvaggurYc/pub",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of those stunts was a drag race against a Porsche 911, while *towing* a Porsche 911. Insane, yes! Elon Musk claimed “it can tow a Porsche 911 across the 1/4 mile faster than the Porsche 911 can go by itself after showing a clip of it beating a Porsche 911 in an 1/8th mile drag race. Fair statement? Not exactly.This video seeks to answer the question: which car is really faster in the 1/4 mile, a 2023 Porsche 911, or Tesla's Cybertruck towing a 911?

However, it turns out the 2 TASes actually contained slight mods that disabled game crashes.  This is understandable since they were made before the game crash triggers were known, so avoiding them would be an annoying process of trial and error.  It turns out that on a TAS of a full vanilla cart, there is a very obscure level desync glitch that causes the glitched colors to switch levels.  This causes Level 255 gets a purple palette instead of red.Music Used:Ascent to the Station - Synthwave https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5L-CY9TcRcSynthwave Retrowave 80s Music - Top Flow Music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LqQ9rlRdPQWinds - HurricaneTurtle https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bJM20iQjW4Polar Bears - Vaporwave https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_jRGI3nXzkHOME - Hold https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ty-qFZZPZkTetris Music 3 Remix - on my PatreonAries Beats - Turbo Rush https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cU2r71afskWorld Record Pace - Caleb Mickus https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1zM6NizEi0MONIN - Highway https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X6R1pGTvysHOME - Pyxis https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ax6jTZlu_gSupport Future Videos: http://www.patreon.com/agamescoutMy Twitch: http://www.twitch.tv/agamescoutMy Discord server: https://discord.gg/M9DQ7kTDepClassic Tetris Elo: https://www.tinyurl.com/tetriseloClassic Tetris Leaderboards: https://bit.ly/CTHighscoreLB",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s very cool city with so much to explore and so today we’re going on a food tour to eat just a taste of some of the best Italian food and learn a little about this exciting Italian city! Huge thank you to Chiara and my friends from Culinary Backstreets (https://culinarybackstreets.com/)  for arranging this amazing day for me. Highly recommended in Naples or other cities where they offer tours. Here’s everything we ate on this Naples food tour: Pasticceria Capriccio - This old bakery in Naples is most famous for their Baba, a rum soaked cake, originating in Poland and France, but loved and adapted into Naples. Next up Chiara took us on an exploration of one of the oldest markets in Naples, a place where you can really see the culture and life of Naples. It loved the colorful mix of fresh vegetables, clothes, Maradona shops, and artisans. The main thing I tried in the market was Limonata a cosce aperte - “open legs lemonade” - lemon juice, sulfur water, and bicarbonate!È Pronto ‘O Mangià - Now we’re moving on to some of the best Italian food I’ve had - a variety of spaghetti pasta dishes, a truly Naples food institution. We tried spaghetti alle vongole - Neapolitan style spaghetti with clams, spaghetti alla Pignatiello - spaghetti with mixed seafood, and frittura di paranza - mixed fried seafood, all of which were outstanding. Without a doubt the seafood spaghetti was the best spaghetti of my life and cooked perfectly. Lombardi 1892 - You can’t go to Naples without eating pizza, and the original Neapolitan pizza. Pizza was invented in and around Naples, and they have the world’s original pizzeria. While we didn’t go to the original pizzeria, we went to a place that serves traditional Naples pizza and some of the best. This time, just had to go with the classic - Pizza Margherita - tomatoes, basil, buffalo mozzarella, and it was everything I hoped for! Sorbillo Pizza Fritta - Finally to wrap up this Italian street food tour in Naples I couldn't leave without trying deep fried pizza. I met up with some friends and deep fried pizza at Sorbillo Pizza Fritta. It’s definitely something that’s a little messy, but extremely tasty - loaded with melty oozing cheese and tomato sauce!If you love food, Naples is a city you have to visit. There’s always something unique and exciting everywhere you look - What a city!

After a group of would-be criminals kidnap the 12-year-old ballerina daughter of a powerful underworld figure, all they have to do to collect a $50 million ransom is watch the girl overnight. In an isolated mansion, the captors start to dwindle, one by one, and they discover, to their mounting horror, that they’re locked inside with no normal little girl.  From Radio Silence—the directing team of Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett behind the terrifying modern horror hits Ready or Not, 2022’s Scream and last year’s Scream VI—comes a brash, blood-thirsty new vision of the vampire flick, written by Stephen Shields (The Hole in the Ground, Zombie Bashers) and Guy Busick (Scream franchise, Ready or Not). Abigail stars Melissa Barrera (Scream franchise, In the Heights), Dan Stevens (Gaslit, Legion), Kathryn Newton (Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Freaky), William Catlett (Black Lightning, True Story), Kevin Durand (Resident Evil: Retribution, X-Men Origins: Wolverine) and Angus Cloud (Euphoria, North Hollywood) as the kidnappers and Alisha Weir (Roald Dahl’s Matilda the Musical, Darklands) as Abigail. The film produced by William Sherak (Scream franchise, Ready or Not), Paul Neinstein (Scream franchise; executive producer, The Night Agent) and James Vanderbilt (Zodiac, Scream franchise) for Project X Entertainment, by Tripp Vinson (Ready or Not, Journey 2: The Mysterious Island) and by Radio Silence’s Chad Vilella (executive producer Ready or Not and Scream franchise).

Godkings hate this one weird trick!This was a lot of fun to work on because I got to spend a lot of time learning THE TRUTH ABOUT GOLD and by that I mean actually interesting facts about how humans use gold. The mythology of gold actually makes a lot of sense through the lens of its physical properties, the fact that ancient humans could make things out of it and those things would outlive generations. It's just rare enough that societal elites can monopolize it, but common enough you can gather enough to actually make stuff with it. So these things, namely jewellery for the leaders, are so resistant to the elements that you can see how the gold itself became representative of the power of the kings, of their claimed immortality.Written and performed by Dan OlsonCrowdfunding: https://www.patreon.com/foldablehumanTwitter: https://twitter.com/FoldableHuman00:00:00 - Gold Open00:00:53 - Ads for gold00:03:05 - Gold is interesting00:07:17 - Not everything is rosy for gold00:11:45 - Enter the World Gold Council00:14:56 - A journey with Idris Elba00:20:02 - It's boring00:22:22 - Colonialism00:24:50 - The environment00:33:52 - The rest of the doc00:36:03 - Reception00:37:47 - The Golden Thread00:39:53 - Selling shovels in a gold rush",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm Brian Barczyk, and I have been daily vlogging on YouTube since May 10, 2016 sharing my amazing life filled with animals. My journey here on YouTube and social media has been truly magnificent and magical. Since 2016, I've been part of TV network series, produced my own documentary in South Africa, traveled the world to meet incredible animals and animal lovers, started a podcast, created a convention for animal content creators, built and expanded The Reptarium - an interactive reptile Zoo in Utica, Michigan and so much more. In March 2023, just as we were ready to break ground on our expanded facility, I received a life-altering diagnosis of inoperable Pancreatic Cancer. Despite the challenges and my fears, the amazing community we've built on YouTube over the last 7+ years has kept me inspired to continue sharing my journey.Now, I'm fully committed to building our expanded facility, Legasea Aquarium & The Reptarium, just across the street. This project represents resilience and the pursuit of dreams in difficult times. With the incredible support of our community, the #ReptileArmy, we're turning obstacles into opportunities. Together, let's create a brighter future for reptiles and all animals, inspiring others to embrace their passions in the face of adversity.Join us on this inspiring journey of discovery, conservation, and hope. Together, we'll make a lasting impact and celebrate the extraordinary animal world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But, now in 2024 McDonalds Corp has decided to start an entirely BRAND NEW fast food chain called CosMc’s. But why, loyal Theorist? Why start a new chain?

Hi, I’m Krebs Gorlon the owner/operator of this YouTube channel (not affiliated with MrBeast) and I’m here today to share with you a video. A lovely video indeed about three stunted men in their 40’s that dress up in Star Trek costumes and play a 30-year-old trivia game. Real men are out there in the cold fixing downed electrical lines, savings lives at hospitals, or providing air traffic control for our nations busiest airports. These men are doing this…. In olden days they would have been called “village idiots” perhaps even court jesters. Morons who shame thyselves for the delight of the King. In the 1800’s they would be circus freaks or even clowns – a shameful profession that does nothing for the betterment of the world other than entertain the regular townsfolk while they slurp down turkey legs coated in meat slime. With every stale laugh, stinky belch-filled chuckle, and gape-mouthed pointed finger, a piece of their soul is taken away. If there was any soul to begin with. Today, morons, clowns, court jesters, and idiots are called “YouTubers”. From dimwits opening up a Walmart “toy haul”, to content thieves reacting to “hair dye fails”, and buffoons playing a board game so you can watch them play it, this generation of artless village idiots have a new bell to ring in the town square. Just a digital one that uploads 9,000,000,000,000 hours of new content every second. I’m afraid to say our dear friends at RLM are no different. For this channel is filled with endless tales told by idiots full of sound and fury and signifying nothing but Star Trek trivia and the occasional movie review. This time Mike is out for revenge. In our last battle, Mike was winning and made a crucial mistake in the final question. This prompted the internet to crown Rich Evans as the king of all TNG trivia. Winning by a simple question doth not make one a king of trivia. Showing relentless and consistent knowledge is how to achieve that. I’m afraid to say Mike has and will continue to do that time and time again with surgeon-like precision. Evans, I hate to say it, is on his last leg mentally. Sure, Mike makes a mistake here and there, but his wit and knowledge remain strong and intact. Not much remains in Evans’ soiled soul. His meat sack body is nothing but a rotting bag of regret. Sure, he remembers some things about TNG, but did he retain anything else? Probably not. He’s seen with his own eyes Star Trek turn into a living nightmare and a joke. Star Trek was once a bastion of hope for lonely nerds in High School. If you liked Star Trek The Next Generation (or Star Trek in general) you were relentlessly mocked. Why? Because the show was thoughtful, proposed interesting ideas, and was scientifically methodical. It was the opposite of cool. It was the opposite of an exciting football game or going to a concert and pushing your friends in a mosh pit. Now, Star Trek is a football game and a mosh pit. It’s made for the dimwits who can’t hold their attention for 5 minutes without a joke or a quip or a stupid comment or something exploding or something dumb happening. No, our last sanctuary, if you will, is cuddling up with that warm blanket of nostalgia with a show that will never happen again. Committing each and every episode and it’s details to memory. To save and preserve a glorious time when life was worth living. So sit back and relax. Pour yourself a frosty beverage and watch as the last of the greatest generation mull over trivia questions read to them by a man who is allergic to barbers. Watch two old friends who met in 1995 and bonded over comic books and Star Trek, things that would get you beat up back then but are now cool, push their memories to the limit in a trivia battle for the soul of our nation. - Krebs Gorlon",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This week I am starting on a project that I have been thinking about for quite some time. I want to create a whole new universe of original characters. Some of these characters will be based on characters of mine that I've already done, and some will be brand new. I am really invested in the idea, so I hope you guys enjoy. In this video, I focus on making the 2 part mold out of silicone and using casting material to create my base character that I will then sculpt onto with air dry clay and finally paint! The painting comes next week, so don't forget to come back next Friday.

I'm 29 and like doing creative activities (mostly painting on things), or really anything that gives me an excuse to use rainbows, sprinkles and my own cutesy characters in excess. I'm heavy into editing, so my video are chalk full of sound effects, filters and lil....moments, or as we like to call them MEmes. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and various other items I find. I also love to draw, traditionally and digitally. I'm not the most skilled artist out here, but I like to focus on having fun with creativity and being able to laugh at my own mistakes.

Taken at face value, one might hear that sentence and imagine the Cold War took the combatants by surprise, how could friends so quickly become enemies, after all? But the great irony was that not only was the Cold War not a surprise, but both sides knew it was coming. Even when they had been allies. The Cold War was as pure of a war of ideologies as one could get, not a war of armies and weapons, but one of influence and power. The United States sought to align the world with their capitalist economic model while the Soviets put their effort into reinforcing the communist model, this clash of economic ideologies led to a lot of tension, amplified by the fact that if one side was pushed too hard, nukes would follow. That possibility made this war one of the scariest, even though no shots were fired. For as Albert Einstein is often quoted to have said, I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.Works Consulted / Read More: I had way too many to put into a video description, I put my sources in this google dog here if you are curious: https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSKjmMDHuAPoF88CzfMJEOcAxmNe3hQRLOj4cMzm5YYY9tYUy6g86KYTeVXecuZyzPqghSjvaggurYc/pub",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it turns out the 2 TASes actually contained slight mods that disabled game crashes.  This is understandable since they were made before the game crash triggers were known, so avoiding them would be an annoying process of trial and error.  It turns out that on a TAS of a full vanilla cart, there is a very obscure level desync glitch that causes the glitched colors to switch levels.  This causes Level 255 gets a purple palette instead of red.Music Used:Ascent to the Station - Synthwave https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5L-CY9TcRcSynthwave Retrowave 80s Music - Top Flow Music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LqQ9rlRdPQWinds - HurricaneTurtle https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bJM20iQjW4Polar Bears - Vaporwave https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_jRGI3nXzkHOME - Hold https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ty-qFZZPZkTetris Music 3 Remix - on my PatreonAries Beats - Turbo Rush https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cU2r71afskWorld Record Pace - Caleb Mickus https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1zM6NizEi0MONIN - Highway https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X6R1pGTvysHOME - Pyxis https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ax6jTZlu_gSupport Future Videos: http://www.patreon.com/agamescoutMy Twitch: http://www.twitch.tv/agamescoutMy Discord server: https://discord.gg/M9DQ7kTDepClassic Tetris Elo: https://www.tinyurl.com/tetriseloClassic Tetris Leaderboards: https://bit.ly/CTHighscoreLB",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s very cool city with so much to explore and so today we’re going on a food tour to eat just a taste of some of the best Italian food and learn a little about this exciting Italian city! Huge thank you to Chiara and my friends from Culinary Backstreets (https://culinarybackstreets.com/)  for arranging this amazing day for me. Highly recommended in Naples or other cities where they offer tours. Here’s everything we ate on this Naples food tour: Pasticceria Capriccio - This old bakery in Naples is most famous for their Baba, a rum soaked cake, originating in Poland and France, but loved and adapted into Naples. Next up Chiara took us on an exploration of one of the oldest markets in Naples, a place where you can really see the culture and life of Naples. It loved the colorful mix of fresh vegetables, clothes, Maradona shops, and artisans. The main thing I tried in the market was Limonata a cosce aperte - “open legs lemonade” - lemon juice, sulfur water, and bicarbonate!È Pronto ‘O Mangià - Now we’re moving on to some of the best Italian food I’ve had - a variety of spaghetti pasta dishes, a truly Naples food institution. We tried spaghetti alle vongole - Neapolitan style spaghetti with clams, spaghetti alla Pignatiello - spaghetti with mixed seafood, and frittura di paranza - mixed fried seafood, all of which were outstanding. Without a doubt the seafood spaghetti was the best spaghetti of my life and cooked perfectly. Lombardi 1892 - You can’t go to Naples without eating pizza, and the original Neapolitan pizza. Pizza was invented in and around Naples, and they have the world’s original pizzeria. While we didn’t go to the original pizzeria, we went to a place that serves traditional Naples pizza and some of the best. This time, just had to go with the classic - Pizza Margherita - tomatoes, basil, buffalo mozzarella, and it was everything I hoped for! Sorbillo Pizza Fritta - Finally to wrap up this Italian street food tour in Naples I couldn't leave without trying deep fried pizza. I met up with some friends and deep fried pizza at Sorbillo Pizza Fritta. It’s definitely something that’s a little messy, but extremely tasty - loaded with melty oozing cheese and tomato sauce!If you love food, Naples is a city you have to visit.

After a group of would-be criminals kidnap the 12-year-old ballerina daughter of a powerful underworld figure, all they have to do to collect a $50 million ransom is watch the girl overnight. In an isolated mansion, the captors start to dwindle, one by one, and they discover, to their mounting horror, that they’re locked inside with no normal little girl.  From Radio Silence—the directing team of Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett behind the terrifying modern horror hits Ready or Not, 2022’s Scream and last year’s Scream VI—comes a brash, blood-thirsty new vision of the vampire flick, written by Stephen Shields (The Hole in the Ground, Zombie Bashers) and Guy Busick (Scream franchise, Ready or Not). Abigail stars Melissa Barrera (Scream franchise, In the Heights), Dan Stevens (Gaslit, Legion), Kathryn Newton (Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Freaky), William Catlett (Black Lightning, True Story), Kevin Durand (Resident Evil: Retribution, X-Men Origins: Wolverine) and Angus Cloud (Euphoria, North Hollywood) as the kidnappers and Alisha Weir (Roald Dahl’s Matilda the Musical, Darklands) as Abigail. The film produced by William Sherak (Scream franchise, Ready or Not), Paul Neinstein (Scream franchise; executive producer, The Night Agent) and James Vanderbilt (Zodiac, Scream franchise) for Project X Entertainment, by Tripp Vinson (Ready or Not, Journey 2: The Mysterious Island) and by Radio Silence’s Chad Vilella (executive producer Ready or Not and Scream franchise). The executive producers are Ron Lynch and Macdara Kelleher.Follow us on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/AbigailMovie Find us on Instagram at https://www.instagram.com/abigailthemovie/Follow us on X at https://twitter.com/UniversalHorror#AbigailTheMovie",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Godkings hate this one weird trick!This was a lot of fun to work on because I got to spend a lot of time learning THE TRUTH ABOUT GOLD and by that I mean actually interesting facts about how humans use gold. The mythology of gold actually makes a lot of sense through the lens of its physical properties, the fact that ancient humans could make things out of it and those things would outlive generations. It's just rare enough that societal elites can monopolize it, but common enough you can gather enough to actually make stuff with it. So these things, namely jewellery for the leaders, are so resistant to the elements that you can see how the gold itself became representative of the power of the kings, of their claimed immortality.Written and performed by Dan OlsonCrowdfunding: https://www.patreon.com/foldablehumanTwitter: https://twitter.com/FoldableHuman00:00:00 - Gold Open00:00:53 - Ads for gold00:03:05 - Gold is interesting00:07:17 - Not everything is rosy for gold00:11:45 - Enter the World Gold Council00:14:56 - A journey with Idris Elba00:20:02 - It's boring00:22:22 - Colonialism00:24:50 - The environment00:33:52 - The rest of the doc00:36:03 - Reception00:37:47 - The Golden Thread00:39:53 - Selling shovels in a gold rush",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hi, I’m Krebs Gorlon the owner/operator of this YouTube channel (not affiliated with MrBeast) and I’m here today to share with you a video. A lovely video indeed about three stunted men in their 40’s that dress up in Star Trek costumes and play a 30-year-old trivia game. Real men are out there in the cold fixing downed electrical lines, savings lives at hospitals, or providing air traffic control for our nations busiest airports. These men are doing this…. In olden days they would have been called “village idiots” perhaps even court jesters. Morons who shame thyselves for the delight of the King. In the 1800’s they would be circus freaks or even clowns – a shameful profession that does nothing for the betterment of the world other than entertain the regular townsfolk while they slurp down turkey legs coated in meat slime. With every stale laugh, stinky belch-filled chuckle, and gape-mouthed pointed finger, a piece of their soul is taken away. If there was any soul to begin with. Today, morons, clowns, court jesters, and idiots are called “YouTubers”. From dimwits opening up a Walmart “toy haul”, to content thieves reacting to “hair dye fails”, and buffoons playing a board game so you can watch them play it, this generation of artless village idiots have a new bell to ring in the town square. Just a digital one that uploads 9,000,000,000,000 hours of new content every second. I’m afraid to say our dear friends at RLM are no different. For this channel is filled with endless tales told by idiots full of sound and fury and signifying nothing but Star Trek trivia and the occasional movie review. This time Mike is out for revenge. In our last battle, Mike was winning and made a crucial mistake in the final question. This prompted the internet to crown Rich Evans as the king of all TNG trivia. Winning by a simple question doth not make one a king of trivia. Showing relentless and consistent knowledge is how to achieve that. I’m afraid to say Mike has and will continue to do that time and time again with surgeon-like precision. Evans, I hate to say it, is on his last leg mentally. Sure, Mike makes a mistake here and there, but his wit and knowledge remain strong and intact. Not much remains in Evans’ soiled soul. His meat sack body is nothing but a rotting bag of regret. Sure, he remembers some things about TNG, but did he retain anything else? Probably not. He’s seen with his own eyes Star Trek turn into a living nightmare and a joke. Star Trek was once a bastion of hope for lonely nerds in High School. If you liked Star Trek The Next Generation (or Star Trek in general) you were relentlessly mocked. Why? Because the show was thoughtful, proposed interesting ideas, and was scientifically methodical. It was the opposite of cool. It was the opposite of an exciting football game or going to a concert and pushing your friends in a mosh pit. Now, Star Trek is a football game and a mosh pit. It’s made for the dimwits who can’t hold their attention for 5 minutes without a joke or a quip or a stupid comment or something exploding or something dumb happening. No, our last sanctuary, if you will, is cuddling up with that warm blanket of nostalgia with a show that will never happen again. Committing each and every episode and it’s details to memory. To save and preserve a glorious time when life was worth living. So sit back and relax. Pour yourself a frosty beverage and watch as the last of the greatest generation mull over trivia questions read to them by a man who is allergic to barbers. Watch two old friends who met in 1995 and bonded over comic books and Star Trek, things that would get you beat up back then but are now cool, push their memories to the limit in a trivia battle for the soul of our nation. - Krebs Gorlon",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This week I am starting on a project that I have been thinking about for quite some time. I want to create a whole new universe of original characters. Some of these characters will be based on characters of mine that I've already done, and some will be brand new. I am really invested in the idea, so I hope you guys enjoy. In this video, I focus on making the 2 part mold out of silicone and using casting material to create my base character that I will then sculpt onto with air dry clay and finally paint! The painting comes next week, so don't forget to come back next Friday.

I'm 29 and like doing creative activities (mostly painting on things), or really anything that gives me an excuse to use rainbows, sprinkles and my own cutesy characters in excess. I'm heavy into editing, so my video are chalk full of sound effects, filters and lil....moments, or as we like to call them MEmes. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and various other items I find. I also love to draw, traditionally and digitally. I'm not the most skilled artist out here, but I like to focus on having fun with creativity and being able to laugh at my own mistakes.

Taken at face value, one might hear that sentence and imagine the Cold War took the combatants by surprise, how could friends so quickly become enemies, after all? But the great irony was that not only was the Cold War not a surprise, but both sides knew it was coming. Even when they had been allies. The Cold War was as pure of a war of ideologies as one could get, not a war of armies and weapons, but one of influence and power. The United States sought to align the world with their capitalist economic model while the Soviets put their effort into reinforcing the communist model, this clash of economic ideologies led to a lot of tension, amplified by the fact that if one side was pushed too hard, nukes would follow. That possibility made this war one of the scariest, even though no shots were fired. For as Albert Einstein is often quoted to have said, I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.Works Consulted / Read More: I had way too many to put into a video description, I put my sources in this google dog here if you are curious: https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSKjmMDHuAPoF88CzfMJEOcAxmNe3hQRLOj4cMzm5YYY9tYUy6g86KYTeVXecuZyzPqghSjvaggurYc/pub",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it turns out the 2 TASes actually contained slight mods that disabled game crashes.  This is understandable since they were made before the game crash triggers were known, so avoiding them would be an annoying process of trial and error.  It turns out that on a TAS of a full vanilla cart, there is a very obscure level desync glitch that causes the glitched colors to switch levels.  This causes Level 255 gets a purple palette instead of red.Music Used:Ascent to the Station - Synthwave https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5L-CY9TcRcSynthwave Retrowave 80s Music - Top Flow Music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LqQ9rlRdPQWinds - HurricaneTurtle https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bJM20iQjW4Polar Bears - Vaporwave https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_jRGI3nXzkHOME - Hold https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ty-qFZZPZkTetris Music 3 Remix - on my PatreonAries Beats - Turbo Rush https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cU2r71afskWorld Record Pace - Caleb Mickus https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1zM6NizEi0MONIN - Highway https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X6R1pGTvysHOME - Pyxis https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ax6jTZlu_gSupport Future Videos: http://www.patreon.com/agamescoutMy Twitch: http://www.twitch.tv/agamescoutMy Discord server: https://discord.gg/M9DQ7kTDepClassic Tetris Elo: https://www.tinyurl.com/tetriseloClassic Tetris Leaderboards: https://bit.ly/CTHighscoreLB",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s very cool city with so much to explore and so today we’re going on a food tour to eat just a taste of some of the best Italian food and learn a little about this exciting Italian city! Huge thank you to Chiara and my friends from Culinary Backstreets (https://culinarybackstreets.com/)  for arranging this amazing day for me. Highly recommended in Naples or other cities where they offer tours. Here’s everything we ate on this Naples food tour: Pasticceria Capriccio - This old bakery in Naples is most famous for their Baba, a rum soaked cake, originating in Poland and France, but loved and adapted into Naples. Next up Chiara took us on an exploration of one of the oldest markets in Naples, a place where you can really see the culture and life of Naples. It loved the colorful mix of fresh vegetables, clothes, Maradona shops, and artisans. The main thing I tried in the market was Limonata a cosce aperte - “open legs lemonade” - lemon juice, sulfur water, and bicarbonate!È Pronto ‘O Mangià - Now we’re moving on to some of the best Italian food I’ve had - a variety of spaghetti pasta dishes, a truly Naples food institution. We tried spaghetti alle vongole - Neapolitan style spaghetti with clams, spaghetti alla Pignatiello - spaghetti with mixed seafood, and frittura di paranza - mixed fried seafood, all of which were outstanding. Without a doubt the seafood spaghetti was the best spaghetti of my life and cooked perfectly. Lombardi 1892 - You can’t go to Naples without eating pizza, and the original Neapolitan pizza. Pizza was invented in and around Naples, and they have the world’s original pizzeria. While we didn’t go to the original pizzeria, we went to a place that serves traditional Naples pizza and some of the best. This time, just had to go with the classic - Pizza Margherita - tomatoes, basil, buffalo mozzarella, and it was everything I hoped for! Sorbillo Pizza Fritta - Finally to wrap up this Italian street food tour in Naples I couldn't leave without trying deep fried pizza. I met up with some friends and deep fried pizza at Sorbillo Pizza Fritta. It’s definitely something that’s a little messy, but extremely tasty - loaded with melty oozing cheese and tomato sauce!If you love food, Naples is a city you have to visit. There’s always something unique and exciting everywhere you look - What a city!

After a group of would-be criminals kidnap the 12-year-old ballerina daughter of a powerful underworld figure, all they have to do to collect a $50 million ransom is watch the girl overnight. In an isolated mansion, the captors start to dwindle, one by one, and they discover, to their mounting horror, that they’re locked inside with no normal little girl.  From Radio Silence—the directing team of Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett behind the terrifying modern horror hits Ready or Not, 2022’s Scream and last year’s Scream VI—comes a brash, blood-thirsty new vision of the vampire flick, written by Stephen Shields (The Hole in the Ground, Zombie Bashers) and Guy Busick (Scream franchise, Ready or Not). Abigail stars Melissa Barrera (Scream franchise, In the Heights), Dan Stevens (Gaslit, Legion), Kathryn Newton (Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Freaky), William Catlett (Black Lightning, True Story), Kevin Durand (Resident Evil: Retribution, X-Men Origins: Wolverine) and Angus Cloud (Euphoria, North Hollywood) as the kidnappers and Alisha Weir (Roald Dahl’s Matilda the Musical, Darklands) as Abigail. The film produced by William Sherak (Scream franchise, Ready or Not), Paul Neinstein (Scream franchise; executive producer, The Night Agent) and James Vanderbilt (Zodiac, Scream franchise) for Project X Entertainment, by Tripp Vinson (Ready or Not, Journey 2: The Mysterious Island) and by Radio Silence’s Chad Vilella (executive producer Ready or Not and Scream franchise).

Godkings hate this one weird trick!This was a lot of fun to work on because I got to spend a lot of time learning THE TRUTH ABOUT GOLD and by that I mean actually interesting facts about how humans use gold. The mythology of gold actually makes a lot of sense through the lens of its physical properties, the fact that ancient humans could make things out of it and those things would outlive generations. It's just rare enough that societal elites can monopolize it, but common enough you can gather enough to actually make stuff with it. So these things, namely jewellery for the leaders, are so resistant to the elements that you can see how the gold itself became representative of the power of the kings, of their claimed immortality.Written and performed by Dan OlsonCrowdfunding: https://www.patreon.com/foldablehumanTwitter: https://twitter.com/FoldableHuman00:00:00 - Gold Open00:00:53 - Ads for gold00:03:05 - Gold is interesting00:07:17 - Not everything is rosy for gold00:11:45 - Enter the World Gold Council00:14:56 - A journey with Idris Elba00:20:02 - It's boring00:22:22 - Colonialism00:24:50 - The environment00:33:52 - The rest of the doc00:36:03 - Reception00:37:47 - The Golden Thread00:39:53 - Selling shovels in a gold rush",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Just go ahead and vote for Big Yeti below. https://www.votepca.com/pop-culture/the-athleteThen we get right into wildcard weekend with Travis recapping the coldest football game ever played at Arrowhead, revealing what lengths players went to to stay warm, and why Rashee Rice has suddenly been unstoppable. We then get to Jason and the Eagles coming up short in Tampa capping off a rough end of the season. Jason breaks down the reactions from the players in the locker room, what he was feeling on the sideline, and his thoughts on what happens next. The guys also go around the league to recap a wild first week of the playoffs including CJ Stroud pulling off the upset against the Browns, the Packers shocking the world in Dallas, Detroit winning its first playoff game in over 30 years, and the insanity that was the Bills snowy win over the Steelers. We also touch on some of the major coaching shakeups from around the league, get an update on how Jason feels about scented candles, and decide on the best Girl Scout Cookie thanks to a wonderful not dumb question. And for those of you looking to compete in our first-ever fan contest, we will be putting out the full Best Team Name bracket and link to enter later today. Follow us on social for details.

B1A9fjoqTn8,Star Trek: The Next Generation Trivia (Part 2 of 10),2024-01-14T21:42:50Z,UCrTNhL_yO3tPTdQ5XgmmWjA,RedLetterMedia,24.0,2024-01-18T00:00:00Z,redlettermedia|red letter media|red|letter|media|plinkett|half in the bag|mike stoklasa|jay bauman|rich evans,547251.0,31878.0,0.0,3070.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B1A9fjoqTn8/default.jpg,False,FALSE,"Trivia revenge is a dish best served with a side of jerk chicken. Hi, I’m Krebs Gorlon the owner/operator of this YouTube channel (not affiliated with MrBeast) and I’m here today to share with you a video. A lovely video indeed about three stunted men in their 40’s that dress up in Star Trek costumes and play a 30-year-old trivia game. Real men are out there in the cold fixing downed electrical lines, savings lives at hospitals, or providing air traffic control for our nations busiest airports. These men are doing this…. In olden days they would have been called “village idiots” perhaps even court jesters. Morons who shame thyselves for the delight of the King. In the 1800’s they would be circus freaks or even clowns – a shameful profession that does nothing for the betterment of the world other than entertain the regular townsfolk while they slurp down turkey legs coated in meat slime. With every stale laugh, stinky belch-filled chuckle, and gape-mouthed pointed finger, a piece of their soul is taken away. If there was any soul to begin with. Today, morons, clowns, court jesters, and idiots are called “YouTubers”. From dimwits opening up a Walmart “toy haul”, to content thieves reacting to “hair dye fails”, and buffoons playing a board game so you can watch them play it, this generation of artless village idiots have a new bell to ring in the town square. Just a digital one that uploads 9,000,000,000,000 hours of new content every second. I’m afraid to say our dear friends at RLM are no different. For this channel is filled with endless tales told by idiots full of sound and fury and signifying nothing but Star Trek trivia and the occasional movie review. This time Mike is out for revenge. In our last battle, Mike was winning and made a crucial mistake in the final question. This prompted the internet to crown Rich Evans as the king of all TNG trivia. Winning by a simple question doth not make one a king of trivia. Showing relentless and consistent knowledge is how to achieve that. I’m afraid to say Mike has and will continue to do that time and time again with surgeon-like precision. Evans, I hate to say it, is on his last leg mentally. Sure, Mike makes a mistake here and there, but his wit and knowledge remain strong and intact. Not much remains in Evans’ soiled soul. His meat sack body is nothing but a rotting bag of regret. Sure, he remembers some things about TNG, but did he retain anything else? Probably not. He’s seen with his own eyes Star Trek turn into a living nightmare and a joke. Star Trek was once a bastion of hope for lonely nerds in High School. If you liked Star Trek The Next Generation (or Star Trek in general) you were relentlessly mocked. Why? Because the show was thoughtful, proposed interesting ideas, and was scientifically methodical. It was the opposite of cool. It was the opposite of an exciting football game or going to a concert and pushing your friends in a mosh pit. Now, Star Trek is a football game and a mosh pit. It’s made for the dimwits who can’t hold their attention for 5 minutes without a joke or a quip or a stupid comment or something exploding or something dumb happening. No, our last sanctuary, if you will, is cuddling up with that warm blanket of nostalgia with a show that will never happen again. Committing each and every episode and it’s details to memory. To save and preserve a glorious time when life was worth living. So sit back and relax. Pour yourself a frosty beverage and watch as the last of the greatest generation mull over trivia questions read to them by a man who is allergic to barbers. Watch two old friends who met in 1995 and bonded over comic books and Star Trek, things that would get you beat up back then but are now cool, push their memories to the limit in a trivia battle for the soul of our nation. - Krebs Gorlon",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This week I am starting on a project that I have been thinking about for quite some time. I want to create a whole new universe of original characters. Some of these characters will be based on characters of mine that I've already done, and some will be brand new. I am really invested in the idea, so I hope you guys enjoy. In this video, I focus on making the 2 part mold out of silicone and using casting material to create my base character that I will then sculpt onto with air dry clay and finally paint! The painting comes next week, so don't forget to come back next Friday.

I'm 29 and like doing creative activities (mostly painting on things), or really anything that gives me an excuse to use rainbows, sprinkles and my own cutesy characters in excess. I'm heavy into editing, so my video are chalk full of sound effects, filters and lil....moments, or as we like to call them MEmes. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and various other items I find. I also love to draw, traditionally and digitally. I'm not the most skilled artist out here, but I like to focus on having fun with creativity and being able to laugh at my own mistakes.

Taken at face value, one might hear that sentence and imagine the Cold War took the combatants by surprise, how could friends so quickly become enemies, after all? But the great irony was that not only was the Cold War not a surprise, but both sides knew it was coming. Even when they had been allies. The Cold War was as pure of a war of ideologies as one could get, not a war of armies and weapons, but one of influence and power. The United States sought to align the world with their capitalist economic model while the Soviets put their effort into reinforcing the communist model, this clash of economic ideologies led to a lot of tension, amplified by the fact that if one side was pushed too hard, nukes would follow. That possibility made this war one of the scariest, even though no shots were fired. For as Albert Einstein is often quoted to have said, I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.Works Consulted / Read More: I had way too many to put into a video description, I put my sources in this google dog here if you are curious: https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSKjmMDHuAPoF88CzfMJEOcAxmNe3hQRLOj4cMzm5YYY9tYUy6g86KYTeVXecuZyzPqghSjvaggurYc/pub",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of those stunts was a drag race against a Porsche 911, while *towing* a Porsche 911. Insane, yes! Elon Musk claimed “it can tow a Porsche 911 across the 1/4 mile faster than the Porsche 911 can go by itself after showing a clip of it beating a Porsche 911 in an 1/8th mile drag race. Fair statement? Not exactly.This video seeks to answer the question: which car is really faster in the 1/4 mile, a 2023 Porsche 911, or Tesla's Cybertruck towing a 911?

However, it turns out the 2 TASes actually contained slight mods that disabled game crashes.  This is understandable since they were made before the game crash triggers were known, so avoiding them would be an annoying process of trial and error.  It turns out that on a TAS of a full vanilla cart, there is a very obscure level desync glitch that causes the glitched colors to switch levels.  This causes Level 255 gets a purple palette instead of red.Music Used:Ascent to the Station - Synthwave https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5L-CY9TcRcSynthwave Retrowave 80s Music - Top Flow Music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LqQ9rlRdPQWinds - HurricaneTurtle https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bJM20iQjW4Polar Bears - Vaporwave https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_jRGI3nXzkHOME - Hold https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ty-qFZZPZkTetris Music 3 Remix - on my PatreonAries Beats - Turbo Rush https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cU2r71afskWorld Record Pace - Caleb Mickus https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1zM6NizEi0MONIN - Highway https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X6R1pGTvysHOME - Pyxis https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ax6jTZlu_gSupport Future Videos: http://www.patreon.com/agamescoutMy Twitch: http://www.twitch.tv/agamescoutMy Discord server: https://discord.gg/M9DQ7kTDepClassic Tetris Elo: https://www.tinyurl.com/tetriseloClassic Tetris Leaderboards: https://bit.ly/CTHighscoreLB",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s very cool city with so much to explore and so today we’re going on a food tour to eat just a taste of some of the best Italian food and learn a little about this exciting Italian city! Huge thank you to Chiara and my friends from Culinary Backstreets (https://culinarybackstreets.com/)  for arranging this amazing day for me. Highly recommended in Naples or other cities where they offer tours. Here’s everything we ate on this Naples food tour: Pasticceria Capriccio - This old bakery in Naples is most famous for their Baba, a rum soaked cake, originating in Poland and France, but loved and adapted into Naples. Next up Chiara took us on an exploration of one of the oldest markets in Naples, a place where you can really see the culture and life of Naples. It loved the colorful mix of fresh vegetables, clothes, Maradona shops, and artisans. The main thing I tried in the market was Limonata a cosce aperte - “open legs lemonade” - lemon juice, sulfur water, and bicarbonate!È Pronto ‘O Mangià - Now we’re moving on to some of the best Italian food I’ve had - a variety of spaghetti pasta dishes, a truly Naples food institution. We tried spaghetti alle vongole - Neapolitan style spaghetti with clams, spaghetti alla Pignatiello - spaghetti with mixed seafood, and frittura di paranza - mixed fried seafood, all of which were outstanding. Without a doubt the seafood spaghetti was the best spaghetti of my life and cooked perfectly. Lombardi 1892 - You can’t go to Naples without eating pizza, and the original Neapolitan pizza. Pizza was invented in and around Naples, and they have the world’s original pizzeria. While we didn’t go to the original pizzeria, we went to a place that serves traditional Naples pizza and some of the best. This time, just had to go with the classic - Pizza Margherita - tomatoes, basil, buffalo mozzarella, and it was everything I hoped for! Sorbillo Pizza Fritta - Finally to wrap up this Italian street food tour in Naples I couldn't leave without trying deep fried pizza. I met up with some friends and deep fried pizza at Sorbillo Pizza Fritta. It’s definitely something that’s a little messy, but extremely tasty - loaded with melty oozing cheese and tomato sauce!If you love food, Naples is a city you have to visit. There’s always something unique and exciting everywhere you look - What a city!

After a group of would-be criminals kidnap the 12-year-old ballerina daughter of a powerful underworld figure, all they have to do to collect a $50 million ransom is watch the girl overnight. In an isolated mansion, the captors start to dwindle, one by one, and they discover, to their mounting horror, that they’re locked inside with no normal little girl.  From Radio Silence—the directing team of Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett behind the terrifying modern horror hits Ready or Not, 2022’s Scream and last year’s Scream VI—comes a brash, blood-thirsty new vision of the vampire flick, written by Stephen Shields (The Hole in the Ground, Zombie Bashers) and Guy Busick (Scream franchise, Ready or Not). Abigail stars Melissa Barrera (Scream franchise, In the Heights), Dan Stevens (Gaslit, Legion), Kathryn Newton (Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Freaky), William Catlett (Black Lightning, True Story), Kevin Durand (Resident Evil: Retribution, X-Men Origins: Wolverine) and Angus Cloud (Euphoria, North Hollywood) as the kidnappers and Alisha Weir (Roald Dahl’s Matilda the Musical, Darklands) as Abigail. The film produced by William Sherak (Scream franchise, Ready or Not), Paul Neinstein (Scream franchise; executive producer, The Night Agent) and James Vanderbilt (Zodiac, Scream franchise) for Project X Entertainment, by Tripp Vinson (Ready or Not, Journey 2: The Mysterious Island) and by Radio Silence’s Chad Vilella (executive producer Ready or Not and Scream franchise).

Godkings hate this one weird trick!This was a lot of fun to work on because I got to spend a lot of time learning THE TRUTH ABOUT GOLD and by that I mean actually interesting facts about how humans use gold. The mythology of gold actually makes a lot of sense through the lens of its physical properties, the fact that ancient humans could make things out of it and those things would outlive generations. It's just rare enough that societal elites can monopolize it, but common enough you can gather enough to actually make stuff with it. So these things, namely jewellery for the leaders, are so resistant to the elements that you can see how the gold itself became representative of the power of the kings, of their claimed immortality.Written and performed by Dan OlsonCrowdfunding: https://www.patreon.com/foldablehumanTwitter: https://twitter.com/FoldableHuman00:00:00 - Gold Open00:00:53 - Ads for gold00:03:05 - Gold is interesting00:07:17 - Not everything is rosy for gold00:11:45 - Enter the World Gold Council00:14:56 - A journey with Idris Elba00:20:02 - It's boring00:22:22 - Colonialism00:24:50 - The environment00:33:52 - The rest of the doc00:36:03 - Reception00:37:47 - The Golden Thread00:39:53 - Selling shovels in a gold rush",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this episode, we quickly settle the debate on the better All-Pro award and decide to go ahead and rig the vote to get Travis a People’s Choice Award. Just go ahead and vote for Big Yeti below. https://www.votepca.com/pop-culture/the-athleteThen we get right into wildcard weekend with Travis recapping the coldest football game ever played at Arrowhead, revealing what lengths players went to to stay warm, and why Rashee Rice has suddenly been unstoppable. We then get to Jason and the Eagles coming up short in Tampa capping off a rough end of the season. Jason breaks down the reactions from the players in the locker room, what he was feeling on the sideline, and his thoughts on what happens next. The guys also go around the league to recap a wild first week of the playoffs including CJ Stroud pulling off the upset against the Browns, the Packers shocking the world in Dallas, Detroit winning its first playoff game in over 30 years, and the insanity that was the Bills snowy win over the Steelers. We also touch on some of the major coaching shakeups from around the league, get an update on how Jason feels about scented candles, and decide on the best Girl Scout Cookie thanks to a wonderful not dumb question. And for those of you looking to compete in our first-ever fan contest, we will be putting out the full Best Team Name bracket and link to enter later today. Follow us on social for details. We will be back Friday with a preview of the Chiefs Divisional games in Buffalo maybe the most terrifying Travis fan art we’ve ever seen and a full breakdown of the first round of our “Best Team Name” bracket challenge.

Hi, I’m Krebs Gorlon the owner/operator of this YouTube channel (not affiliated with MrBeast) and I’m here today to share with you a video. A lovely video indeed about three stunted men in their 40’s that dress up in Star Trek costumes and play a 30-year-old trivia game. Real men are out there in the cold fixing downed electrical lines, savings lives at hospitals, or providing air traffic control for our nations busiest airports. These men are doing this…. In olden days they would have been called “village idiots” perhaps even court jesters. Morons who shame thyselves for the delight of the King. In the 1800’s they would be circus freaks or even clowns – a shameful profession that does nothing for the betterment of the world other than entertain the regular townsfolk while they slurp down turkey legs coated in meat slime. With every stale laugh, stinky belch-filled chuckle, and gape-mouthed pointed finger, a piece of their soul is taken away. If there was any soul to begin with. Today, morons, clowns, court jesters, and idiots are called “YouTubers”. From dimwits opening up a Walmart “toy haul”, to content thieves reacting to “hair dye fails”, and buffoons playing a board game so you can watch them play it, this generation of artless village idiots have a new bell to ring in the town square. Just a digital one that uploads 9,000,000,000,000 hours of new content every second. I’m afraid to say our dear friends at RLM are no different. For this channel is filled with endless tales told by idiots full of sound and fury and signifying nothing but Star Trek trivia and the occasional movie review. This time Mike is out for revenge. In our last battle, Mike was winning and made a crucial mistake in the final question. This prompted the internet to crown Rich Evans as the king of all TNG trivia. Winning by a simple question doth not make one a king of trivia. Showing relentless and consistent knowledge is how to achieve that. I’m afraid to say Mike has and will continue to do that time and time again with surgeon-like precision. Evans, I hate to say it, is on his last leg mentally. Sure, Mike makes a mistake here and there, but his wit and knowledge remain strong and intact. Not much remains in Evans’ soiled soul. His meat sack body is nothing but a rotting bag of regret. Sure, he remembers some things about TNG, but did he retain anything else? Probably not. He’s seen with his own eyes Star Trek turn into a living nightmare and a joke. Star Trek was once a bastion of hope for lonely nerds in High School. If you liked Star Trek The Next Generation (or Star Trek in general) you were relentlessly mocked. Why? Because the show was thoughtful, proposed interesting ideas, and was scientifically methodical. It was the opposite of cool. It was the opposite of an exciting football game or going to a concert and pushing your friends in a mosh pit. Now, Star Trek is a football game and a mosh pit. It’s made for the dimwits who can’t hold their attention for 5 minutes without a joke or a quip or a stupid comment or something exploding or something dumb happening. No, our last sanctuary, if you will, is cuddling up with that warm blanket of nostalgia with a show that will never happen again. Committing each and every episode and it’s details to memory. To save and preserve a glorious time when life was worth living. So sit back and relax. Pour yourself a frosty beverage and watch as the last of the greatest generation mull over trivia questions read to them by a man who is allergic to barbers. Watch two old friends who met in 1995 and bonded over comic books and Star Trek, things that would get you beat up back then but are now cool, push their memories to the limit in a trivia battle for the soul of our nation. - Krebs Gorlon",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This week I am starting on a project that I have been thinking about for quite some time. I want to create a whole new universe of original characters. Some of these characters will be based on characters of mine that I've already done, and some will be brand new. I am really invested in the idea, so I hope you guys enjoy. In this video, I focus on making the 2 part mold out of silicone and using casting material to create my base character that I will then sculpt onto with air dry clay and finally paint! The painting comes next week, so don't forget to come back next Friday.

I'm 29 and like doing creative activities (mostly painting on things), or really anything that gives me an excuse to use rainbows, sprinkles and my own cutesy characters in excess. I'm heavy into editing, so my video are chalk full of sound effects, filters and lil....moments, or as we like to call them MEmes. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and various other items I find. I also love to draw, traditionally and digitally. I'm not the most skilled artist out here, but I like to focus on having fun with creativity and being able to laugh at my own mistakes.

Taken at face value, one might hear that sentence and imagine the Cold War took the combatants by surprise, how could friends so quickly become enemies, after all? But the great irony was that not only was the Cold War not a surprise, but both sides knew it was coming. Even when they had been allies. The Cold War was as pure of a war of ideologies as one could get, not a war of armies and weapons, but one of influence and power. The United States sought to align the world with their capitalist economic model while the Soviets put their effort into reinforcing the communist model, this clash of economic ideologies led to a lot of tension, amplified by the fact that if one side was pushed too hard, nukes would follow. That possibility made this war one of the scariest, even though no shots were fired. For as Albert Einstein is often quoted to have said, I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.Works Consulted / Read More: I had way too many to put into a video description, I put my sources in this google dog here if you are curious: https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSKjmMDHuAPoF88CzfMJEOcAxmNe3hQRLOj4cMzm5YYY9tYUy6g86KYTeVXecuZyzPqghSjvaggurYc/pub",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it turns out the 2 TASes actually contained slight mods that disabled game crashes.  This is understandable since they were made before the game crash triggers were known, so avoiding them would be an annoying process of trial and error.  It turns out that on a TAS of a full vanilla cart, there is a very obscure level desync glitch that causes the glitched colors to switch levels.  This causes Level 255 gets a purple palette instead of red.Music Used:Ascent to the Station - Synthwave https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5L-CY9TcRcSynthwave Retrowave 80s Music - Top Flow Music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LqQ9rlRdPQWinds - HurricaneTurtle https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bJM20iQjW4Polar Bears - Vaporwave https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_jRGI3nXzkHOME - Hold https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ty-qFZZPZkTetris Music 3 Remix - on my PatreonAries Beats - Turbo Rush https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cU2r71afskWorld Record Pace - Caleb Mickus https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1zM6NizEi0MONIN - Highway https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X6R1pGTvysHOME - Pyxis https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ax6jTZlu_gSupport Future Videos: http://www.patreon.com/agamescoutMy Twitch: http://www.twitch.tv/agamescoutMy Discord server: https://discord.gg/M9DQ7kTDepClassic Tetris Elo: https://www.tinyurl.com/tetriseloClassic Tetris Leaderboards: https://bit.ly/CTHighscoreLB",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After a group of would-be criminals kidnap the 12-year-old ballerina daughter of a powerful underworld figure, all they have to do to collect a $50 million ransom is watch the girl overnight. In an isolated mansion, the captors start to dwindle, one by one, and they discover, to their mounting horror, that they’re locked inside with no normal little girl.  From Radio Silence—the directing team of Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett behind the terrifying modern horror hits Ready or Not, 2022’s Scream and last year’s Scream VI—comes a brash, blood-thirsty new vision of the vampire flick, written by Stephen Shields (The Hole in the Ground, Zombie Bashers) and Guy Busick (Scream franchise, Ready or Not). Abigail stars Melissa Barrera (Scream franchise, In the Heights), Dan Stevens (Gaslit, Legion), Kathryn Newton (Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Freaky), William Catlett (Black Lightning, True Story), Kevin Durand (Resident Evil: Retribution, X-Men Origins: Wolverine) and Angus Cloud (Euphoria, North Hollywood) as the kidnappers and Alisha Weir (Roald Dahl’s Matilda the Musical, Darklands) as Abigail. The film produced by William Sherak (Scream franchise, Ready or Not), Paul Neinstein (Scream franchise; executive producer, The Night Agent) and James Vanderbilt (Zodiac, Scream franchise) for Project X Entertainment, by Tripp Vinson (Ready or Not, Journey 2: The Mysterious Island) and by Radio Silence’s Chad Vilella (executive producer Ready or Not and Scream franchise).

Just go ahead and vote for Big Yeti below. https://www.votepca.com/pop-culture/the-athleteThen we get right into wildcard weekend with Travis recapping the coldest football game ever played at Arrowhead, revealing what lengths players went to to stay warm, and why Rashee Rice has suddenly been unstoppable. We then get to Jason and the Eagles coming up short in Tampa capping off a rough end of the season. Jason breaks down the reactions from the players in the locker room, what he was feeling on the sideline, and his thoughts on what happens next. The guys also go around the league to recap a wild first week of the playoffs including CJ Stroud pulling off the upset against the Browns, the Packers shocking the world in Dallas, Detroit winning its first playoff game in over 30 years, and the insanity that was the Bills snowy win over the Steelers. We also touch on some of the major coaching shakeups from around the league, get an update on how Jason feels about scented candles, and decide on the best Girl Scout Cookie thanks to a wonderful not dumb question. And for those of you looking to compete in our first-ever fan contest, we will be putting out the full Best Team Name bracket and link to enter later today. Follow us on social for details.

Hi, I’m Krebs Gorlon the owner/operator of this YouTube channel (not affiliated with MrBeast) and I’m here today to share with you a video. A lovely video indeed about three stunted men in their 40’s that dress up in Star Trek costumes and play a 30-year-old trivia game. Real men are out there in the cold fixing downed electrical lines, savings lives at hospitals, or providing air traffic control for our nations busiest airports. These men are doing this…. In olden days they would have been called “village idiots” perhaps even court jesters. Morons who shame thyselves for the delight of the King. In the 1800’s they would be circus freaks or even clowns – a shameful profession that does nothing for the betterment of the world other than entertain the regular townsfolk while they slurp down turkey legs coated in meat slime. With every stale laugh, stinky belch-filled chuckle, and gape-mouthed pointed finger, a piece of their soul is taken away. If there was any soul to begin with. Today, morons, clowns, court jesters, and idiots are called “YouTubers”. From dimwits opening up a Walmart “toy haul”, to content thieves reacting to “hair dye fails”, and buffoons playing a board game so you can watch them play it, this generation of artless village idiots have a new bell to ring in the town square. Just a digital one that uploads 9,000,000,000,000 hours of new content every second. I’m afraid to say our dear friends at RLM are no different. For this channel is filled with endless tales told by idiots full of sound and fury and signifying nothing but Star Trek trivia and the occasional movie review. This time Mike is out for revenge. In our last battle, Mike was winning and made a crucial mistake in the final question. This prompted the internet to crown Rich Evans as the king of all TNG trivia. Winning by a simple question doth not make one a king of trivia. Showing relentless and consistent knowledge is how to achieve that. I’m afraid to say Mike has and will continue to do that time and time again with surgeon-like precision. Evans, I hate to say it, is on his last leg mentally. Sure, Mike makes a mistake here and there, but his wit and knowledge remain strong and intact. Not much remains in Evans’ soiled soul. His meat sack body is nothing but a rotting bag of regret. Sure, he remembers some things about TNG, but did he retain anything else? Probably not. He’s seen with his own eyes Star Trek turn into a living nightmare and a joke. Star Trek was once a bastion of hope for lonely nerds in High School. If you liked Star Trek The Next Generation (or Star Trek in general) you were relentlessly mocked. Why? Because the show was thoughtful, proposed interesting ideas, and was scientifically methodical. It was the opposite of cool. It was the opposite of an exciting football game or going to a concert and pushing your friends in a mosh pit. Now, Star Trek is a football game and a mosh pit. It’s made for the dimwits who can’t hold their attention for 5 minutes without a joke or a quip or a stupid comment or something exploding or something dumb happening. No, our last sanctuary, if you will, is cuddling up with that warm blanket of nostalgia with a show that will never happen again. Committing each and every episode and it’s details to memory. To save and preserve a glorious time when life was worth living. So sit back and relax. Pour yourself a frosty beverage and watch as the last of the greatest generation mull over trivia questions read to them by a man who is allergic to barbers. Watch two old friends who met in 1995 and bonded over comic books and Star Trek, things that would get you beat up back then but are now cool, push their memories to the limit in a trivia battle for the soul of our nation. - Krebs Gorlon",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was shocked to discover the truth about relations between three existing ant colonies within the vivarium, and watched an intense showdown of ants take place. It opened my eyes to the chilling realities of invasive vs native animal wars that occur in ecosystems, as they compete for resources, food, and space.

This week I am starting on a project that I have been thinking about for quite some time. I want to create a whole new universe of original characters. Some of these characters will be based on characters of mine that I've already done, and some will be brand new. I am really invested in the idea, so I hope you guys enjoy. In this video, I focus on making the 2 part mold out of silicone and using casting material to create my base character that I will then sculpt onto with air dry clay and finally paint! The painting comes next week, so don't forget to come back next Friday.

I'm 29 and like doing creative activities (mostly painting on things), or really anything that gives me an excuse to use rainbows, sprinkles and my own cutesy characters in excess. I'm heavy into editing, so my video are chalk full of sound effects, filters and lil....moments, or as we like to call them MEmes. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and various other items I find. I also love to draw, traditionally and digitally. I'm not the most skilled artist out here, but I like to focus on having fun with creativity and being able to laugh at my own mistakes.

Taken at face value, one might hear that sentence and imagine the Cold War took the combatants by surprise, how could friends so quickly become enemies, after all? But the great irony was that not only was the Cold War not a surprise, but both sides knew it was coming. Even when they had been allies. The Cold War was as pure of a war of ideologies as one could get, not a war of armies and weapons, but one of influence and power. The United States sought to align the world with their capitalist economic model while the Soviets put their effort into reinforcing the communist model, this clash of economic ideologies led to a lot of tension, amplified by the fact that if one side was pushed too hard, nukes would follow.

This week I am continuing on a project that I have been thinking about for quite some time. I want to create a whole new universe of original characters. Some of these characters will be based on characters of mine that I've already done, and some will be brand new. I am really invested in the idea, so I hope you guys enjoy. Last week, I focused on making the 2 part mold out of silicone and using casting material to create my base character that I will then sculpt onto with air dry clay. This week, I finally get to paint and decorate my characters.SUPPLIES I USED (contains affiliates):Das Air Dry Clay: https://amzn.to/3hwUHcXAluminum Foil: https://amzn.to/3U3iDpoLiquitex Gloss Medium: https://amzn.to/3O5FA7zChavant Clay - NSP Soft Green - Sculpting and Modeling Clay: https://amzn.to/3SjBL16Foam Boards: https://amzn.to/48OgAdDHot glue: https://amzn.to/3TjkQcOSilicone Rubber: https://amzn.to/47D1gPBPopsicle Sticks: https://amzn.to/3HhCOICPlastic Cups: https://amzn.to/3SiZG0NMold Release Spray: https://amzn.to/3TXFumbCast: ​​https://amzn.to/3RZm3XBSanding Sticks: https://amzn.to/3S2lpsw___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh) Elizabeth and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 29 and like doing creative activities (mostly painting on things), or really anything that gives me an excuse to use rainbows, sprinkles and my own cutesy characters in excess. I'm heavy into editing, so my video are chalk full of sound effects, filters and lil....moments, or as we like to call them MEmes. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and various other items I find. I also love to draw, traditionally and digitally. I'm not the most skilled artist out here, but I like to focus on having fun with creativity and being able to laugh at my own mistakes.

Just go ahead and vote for Big Yeti below. https://www.votepca.com/pop-culture/the-athleteThen we get right into wildcard weekend with Travis recapping the coldest football game ever played at Arrowhead, revealing what lengths players went to to stay warm, and why Rashee Rice has suddenly been unstoppable. We then get to Jason and the Eagles coming up short in Tampa capping off a rough end of the season. Jason breaks down the reactions from the players in the locker room, what he was feeling on the sideline, and his thoughts on what happens next. The guys also go around the league to recap a wild first week of the playoffs including CJ Stroud pulling off the upset against the Browns, the Packers shocking the world in Dallas, Detroit winning its first playoff game in over 30 years, and the insanity that was the Bills snowy win over the Steelers. We also touch on some of the major coaching shakeups from around the league, get an update on how Jason feels about scented candles, and decide on the best Girl Scout Cookie thanks to a wonderful not dumb question.

B1A9fjoqTn8,Star Trek: The Next Generation Trivia (Part 2 of 10),2024-01-14T21:42:50Z,UCrTNhL_yO3tPTdQ5XgmmWjA,RedLetterMedia,24.0,2024-01-21T00:00:00Z,redlettermedia|red letter media|red|letter|media|plinkett|half in the bag|mike stoklasa|jay bauman|rich evans,601683.0,33430.0,0.0,3206.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B1A9fjoqTn8/default.jpg,False,FALSE,"Trivia revenge is a dish best served with a side of jerk chicken. Hi, I’m Krebs Gorlon the owner/operator of this YouTube channel (not affiliated with MrBeast) and I’m here today to share with you a video. A lovely video indeed about three stunted men in their 40’s that dress up in Star Trek costumes and play a 30-year-old trivia game. Real men are out there in the cold fixing downed electrical lines, savings lives at hospitals, or providing air traffic control for our nations busiest airports. These men are doing this…. In olden days they would have been called “village idiots” perhaps even court jesters. Morons who shame thyselves for the delight of the King. In the 1800’s they would be circus freaks or even clowns – a shameful profession that does nothing for the betterment of the world other than entertain the regular townsfolk while they slurp down turkey legs coated in meat slime. With every stale laugh, stinky belch-filled chuckle, and gape-mouthed pointed finger, a piece of their soul is taken away. If there was any soul to begin with. Today, morons, clowns, court jesters, and idiots are called “YouTubers”. From dimwits opening up a Walmart “toy haul”, to content thieves reacting to “hair dye fails”, and buffoons playing a board game so you can watch them play it, this generation of artless village idiots have a new bell to ring in the town square. Just a digital one that uploads 9,000,000,000,000 hours of new content every second. I’m afraid to say our dear friends at RLM are no different. For this channel is filled with endless tales told by idiots full of sound and fury and signifying nothing but Star Trek trivia and the occasional movie review. This time Mike is out for revenge. In our last battle, Mike was winning and made a crucial mistake in the final question. This prompted the internet to crown Rich Evans as the king of all TNG trivia. Winning by a simple question doth not make one a king of trivia. Showing relentless and consistent knowledge is how to achieve that. I’m afraid to say Mike has and will continue to do that time and time again with surgeon-like precision. Evans, I hate to say it, is on his last leg mentally. Sure, Mike makes a mistake here and there, but his wit and knowledge remain strong and intact. Not much remains in Evans’ soiled soul. His meat sack body is nothing but a rotting bag of regret. Sure, he remembers some things about TNG, but did he retain anything else? Probably not. He’s seen with his own eyes Star Trek turn into a living nightmare and a joke. Star Trek was once a bastion of hope for lonely nerds in High School. If you liked Star Trek The Next Generation (or Star Trek in general) you were relentlessly mocked. Why? Because the show was thoughtful, proposed interesting ideas, and was scientifically methodical. It was the opposite of cool. It was the opposite of an exciting football game or going to a concert and pushing your friends in a mosh pit. Now, Star Trek is a football game and a mosh pit. It’s made for the dimwits who can’t hold their attention for 5 minutes without a joke or a quip or a stupid comment or something exploding or something dumb happening. No, our last sanctuary, if you will, is cuddling up with that warm blanket of nostalgia with a show that will never happen again. Committing each and every episode and it’s details to memory. To save and preserve a glorious time when life was worth living. So sit back and relax. Pour yourself a frosty beverage and watch as the last of the greatest generation mull over trivia questions read to them by a man who is allergic to barbers. Watch two old friends who met in 1995 and bonded over comic books and Star Trek, things that would get you beat up back then but are now cool, push their memories to the limit in a trivia battle for the soul of our nation. - Krebs Gorlon",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This week I am continuing on a project that I have been thinking about for quite some time. I want to create a whole new universe of original characters. Some of these characters will be based on characters of mine that I've already done, and some will be brand new. I am really invested in the idea, so I hope you guys enjoy. Last week, I focused on making the 2 part mold out of silicone and using casting material to create my base character that I will then sculpt onto with air dry clay. This week, I finally get to paint and decorate my characters.SUPPLIES I USED (contains affiliates):Das Air Dry Clay: https://amzn.to/3hwUHcXAluminum Foil: https://amzn.to/3U3iDpoLiquitex Gloss Medium: https://amzn.to/3O5FA7zChavant Clay - NSP Soft Green - Sculpting and Modeling Clay: https://amzn.to/3SjBL16Foam Boards: https://amzn.to/48OgAdDHot glue: https://amzn.to/3TjkQcOSilicone Rubber: https://amzn.to/47D1gPBPopsicle Sticks: https://amzn.to/3HhCOICPlastic Cups: https://amzn.to/3SiZG0NMold Release Spray: https://amzn.to/3TXFumbCast: ​​https://amzn.to/3RZm3XBSanding Sticks: https://amzn.to/3S2lpsw___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh) Elizabeth and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 29 and like doing creative activities (mostly painting on things), or really anything that gives me an excuse to use rainbows, sprinkles and my own cutesy characters in excess. I'm heavy into editing, so my video are chalk full of sound effects, filters and lil....moments, or as we like to call them MEmes.

If you’re looking to build your credit without adding debt, check out the Experian Smart Money Debit Card and Digital Checking Account. In this episode, we quickly settle the debate on the better All-Pro award and decide to go ahead and rig the vote to get Travis a People’s Choice Award. Just go ahead and vote for Big Yeti below. https://www.votepca.com/pop-culture/the-athleteThen we get right into wildcard weekend with Travis recapping the coldest football game ever played at Arrowhead, revealing what lengths players went to to stay warm, and why Rashee Rice has suddenly been unstoppable. We then get to Jason and the Eagles coming up short in Tampa capping off a rough end of the season. Jason breaks down the reactions from the players in the locker room, what he was feeling on the sideline, and his thoughts on what happens next. The guys also go around the league to recap a wild first week of the playoffs including CJ Stroud pulling off the upset against the Browns, the Packers shocking the world in Dallas, Detroit winning its first playoff game in over 30 years, and the insanity that was the Bills snowy win over the Steelers. We also touch on some of the major coaching shakeups from around the league, get an update on how Jason feels about scented candles, and decide on the best Girl Scout Cookie thanks to a wonderful not dumb question. And for those of you looking to compete in our first-ever fan contest, we will be putting out the full Best Team Name bracket and link to enter later today. Follow us on social for details. We will be back Friday with a preview of the Chiefs Divisional games in Buffalo maybe the most terrifying Travis fan art we’ve ever seen and a full breakdown of the first round of our “Best Team Name” bracket challenge.

B1A9fjoqTn8,Star Trek: The Next Generation Trivia (Part 2 of 10),2024-01-14T21:42:50Z,UCrTNhL_yO3tPTdQ5XgmmWjA,RedLetterMedia,24.0,2024-01-22T00:00:00Z,redlettermedia|red letter media|red|letter|media|plinkett|half in the bag|mike stoklasa|jay bauman|rich evans,609917.0,33696.0,0.0,3231.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B1A9fjoqTn8/default.jpg,False,FALSE,"Trivia revenge is a dish best served with a side of jerk chicken. Hi, I’m Krebs Gorlon the owner/operator of this YouTube channel (not affiliated with MrBeast) and I’m here today to share with you a video. A lovely video indeed about three stunted men in their 40’s that dress up in Star Trek costumes and play a 30-year-old trivia game. Real men are out there in the cold fixing downed electrical lines, savings lives at hospitals, or providing air traffic control for our nations busiest airports. These men are doing this…. In olden days they would have been called “village idiots” perhaps even court jesters. Morons who shame thyselves for the delight of the King. In the 1800’s they would be circus freaks or even clowns – a shameful profession that does nothing for the betterment of the world other than entertain the regular townsfolk while they slurp down turkey legs coated in meat slime. With every stale laugh, stinky belch-filled chuckle, and gape-mouthed pointed finger, a piece of their soul is taken away. If there was any soul to begin with. Today, morons, clowns, court jesters, and idiots are called “YouTubers”. From dimwits opening up a Walmart “toy haul”, to content thieves reacting to “hair dye fails”, and buffoons playing a board game so you can watch them play it, this generation of artless village idiots have a new bell to ring in the town square. Just a digital one that uploads 9,000,000,000,000 hours of new content every second. I’m afraid to say our dear friends at RLM are no different. For this channel is filled with endless tales told by idiots full of sound and fury and signifying nothing but Star Trek trivia and the occasional movie review. This time Mike is out for revenge. In our last battle, Mike was winning and made a crucial mistake in the final question. This prompted the internet to crown Rich Evans as the king of all TNG trivia. Winning by a simple question doth not make one a king of trivia. Showing relentless and consistent knowledge is how to achieve that. I’m afraid to say Mike has and will continue to do that time and time again with surgeon-like precision. Evans, I hate to say it, is on his last leg mentally. Sure, Mike makes a mistake here and there, but his wit and knowledge remain strong and intact. Not much remains in Evans’ soiled soul. His meat sack body is nothing but a rotting bag of regret. Sure, he remembers some things about TNG, but did he retain anything else? Probably not. He’s seen with his own eyes Star Trek turn into a living nightmare and a joke. Star Trek was once a bastion of hope for lonely nerds in High School. If you liked Star Trek The Next Generation (or Star Trek in general) you were relentlessly mocked. Why? Because the show was thoughtful, proposed interesting ideas, and was scientifically methodical. It was the opposite of cool. It was the opposite of an exciting football game or going to a concert and pushing your friends in a mosh pit. Now, Star Trek is a football game and a mosh pit. It’s made for the dimwits who can’t hold their attention for 5 minutes without a joke or a quip or a stupid comment or something exploding or something dumb happening. No, our last sanctuary, if you will, is cuddling up with that warm blanket of nostalgia with a show that will never happen again. Committing each and every episode and it’s details to memory. To save and preserve a glorious time when life was worth living. So sit back and relax. Pour yourself a frosty beverage and watch as the last of the greatest generation mull over trivia questions read to them by a man who is allergic to barbers. Watch two old friends who met in 1995 and bonded over comic books and Star Trek, things that would get you beat up back then but are now cool, push their memories to the limit in a trivia battle for the soul of our nation. - Krebs Gorlon",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We were toying around with the idea of changing our RV to something more suitable for just the two of us, but the timing had to be perfect! After all, we're leaving in late March and will be on the road for most of the year. Once we hit the road, our window for buying and selling an RV would be closed. It's hard to make big changes when we're traveling and dates or events are locked in place. To our surprise, the exact Airstream (and year) we wanted showed up in a new listing, and we immediately called. After discussing price and timing, we decided to change our route to go through Visalia, CA, so we could check it out. We got started with repairs on the first night. During our self-inspection, we knew there was an issue with the voltage. We also identified a few minor issues in other systems. Because we knew we'd likely be modifying these systems anyway, we were not too uptight about it. However, it would have been good to show the proper process of buying a used RV... and not our approach. We'd like to make a video about buying & selling RVs, so we'll try to include that how-to information then. Overall, we're thrilled with this new model, and we've already started making small modifications. For those who wondered why we stayed with an Airstream, it's just the most suitable RV for how we travel. It offers us enough space to stay comfortable for months on the road, but it's small enough that we can camp inside the national parks. Not to mention resale value, which is always at the top of our list when purchasing any depreciating asset.🎬 YouTube Course https://howtostartayoutubechannel.com/ If you have ever thought about starting a YouTube channel or just want even better videos to document your journey, we share everything we've learned.

This will be over three first class flights, starting in the brand new Starlux A350. After we'll move onto the brand new Emirates A380 first class, which features similar finishing to the famous Gamechanger (yes of course there's a shower onboard!). Lastly we'll finish on Etihad's three room apartment in the sky, known as The Residence. This not only has a living room, but a private ensuite bathroom and bedroom!As usual I paid for this trip myself, and due to the complexities of the routing, I was unable to use miles to redeem.

It was an insane financial commitment and huge leap of faith that it would be the boat of our dreams.  And ever since that day…we have been preparing for this one.  The day we would go on our first sail aboard CURIOSITY², our spankin’ new HH44. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------WE’RE JASON AND NIKKI WYNN.  A couple of modern-day documentarians, perpetual travelers, and seekers of tall tales.  We’ve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?  Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life.  It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown.  The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us.Our home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land.  Self-reliance and living a sustainable lifestyle are a must.  It's all about managing our resources and we’re always looking for new and better ways to do so.  We've lived off the grid for over 10 years now in everything from a Van to RV to a Sailboat. And over time we have learned a lot about renewable energy, creating safe drinking water, and managing our waste.Our journey is ever-evolving but the mission remains the same: #CultivateCuriosityTimestamps if you like to Jump Around:00:00 Why Visit Hong Kong02:05 Marine Store in Hong Kong04:51 Best Way to Find Marine Chandlers Around the World07:00 Victoria Harbour & Yacht Club09:13 Train from Hong Kong to Xiamen 11:01 Sea Trial Day from HH Catamarans14:08 Raising the Sails for the First Time16:31 Running through the Sail Suite 19:34 Boat Speed & Hydro Generation Performance20:23 Sailing in China (Taiwan Straights)22:45 Sea Trials is Boat Speak for Solving Issues24:18 Super Quick Sailing with the Reacher28:45 China’s Special Pink Dolphins29:43 Searching for all the Imperfections31:42 Adventures at Low Tide33:37 What’s Next?----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#boatlife #Catamaran #TravelVlog #DigitalNomad #LifeStyle #sailboat #hh44© Gone With the Wynns 2024",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This week I am continuing on a project that I have been thinking about for quite some time. I want to create a whole new universe of original characters. Some of these characters will be based on characters of mine that I've already done, and some will be brand new. I am really invested in the idea, so I hope you guys enjoy. Last week, I focused on making the 2 part mold out of silicone and using casting material to create my base character that I will then sculpt onto with air dry clay. This week, I finally get to paint and decorate my characters.SUPPLIES I USED (contains affiliates):Das Air Dry Clay: https://amzn.to/3hwUHcXAluminum Foil: https://amzn.to/3U3iDpoLiquitex Gloss Medium: https://amzn.to/3O5FA7zChavant Clay - NSP Soft Green - Sculpting and Modeling Clay: https://amzn.to/3SjBL16Foam Boards: https://amzn.to/48OgAdDHot glue: https://amzn.to/3TjkQcOSilicone Rubber: https://amzn.to/47D1gPBPopsicle Sticks: https://amzn.to/3HhCOICPlastic Cups: https://amzn.to/3SiZG0NMold Release Spray: https://amzn.to/3TXFumbCast: ​​https://amzn.to/3RZm3XBSanding Sticks: https://amzn.to/3S2lpsw___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh) Elizabeth and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 29 and like doing creative activities (mostly painting on things), or really anything that gives me an excuse to use rainbows, sprinkles and my own cutesy characters in excess. I'm heavy into editing, so my video are chalk full of sound effects, filters and lil....moments, or as we like to call them MEmes. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and various other items I find. I also love to draw, traditionally and digitally. I'm not the most skilled artist out here, but I like to focus on having fun with creativity and being able to laugh at my own mistakes.

Jason breaks down the reactions from the players in the locker room, what he was feeling on the sideline, and his thoughts on what happens next. The guys also go around the league to recap a wild first week of the playoffs including CJ Stroud pulling off the upset against the Browns, the Packers shocking the world in Dallas, Detroit winning its first playoff game in over 30 years, and the insanity that was the Bills snowy win over the Steelers. We also touch on some of the major coaching shakeups from around the league, get an update on how Jason feels about scented candles, and decide on the best Girl Scout Cookie thanks to a wonderful not dumb question.

Grocery stores are packed with unhealthy, if not dangerous, food items. It's difficult and overwhelming at times to sift through the items and make healthy choices. We’re analyzing the nutrition content of a few different foods to help you better understand what to get and what to avoid. Let me know in the comments which foods you want to learn more about! Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio:Dr. Berg, age 58, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

His use of “doctor” or “Dr.” in relation to himself solely refers to that degree.  Dr. Berg is a licensed chiropractor in Virginia, California, and Louisiana, but he no longer practices chiropractic in any state and does not see patients so he can focus on educating people as a full time activity, yet he maintains an active license.

It does not create a doctor-patient relationship between Dr. Berg and you.

We were toying around with the idea of changing our RV to something more suitable for just the two of us, but the timing had to be perfect! After all, we're leaving in late March and will be on the road for most of the year. Once we hit the road, our window for buying and selling an RV would be closed. It's hard to make big changes when we're traveling and dates or events are locked in place. To our surprise, the exact Airstream (and year) we wanted showed up in a new listing, and we immediately called. After discussing price and timing, we decided to change our route to go through Visalia, CA, so we could check it out. We got started with repairs on the first night. During our self-inspection, we knew there was an issue with the voltage. We also identified a few minor issues in other systems. Because we knew we'd likely be modifying these systems anyway, we were not too uptight about it. However, it would have been good to show the proper process of buying a used RV... and not our approach. We'd like to make a video about buying & selling RVs, so we'll try to include that how-to information then. Overall, we're thrilled with this new model, and we've already started making small modifications. For those who wondered why we stayed with an Airstream, it's just the most suitable RV for how we travel. It offers us enough space to stay comfortable for months on the road, but it's small enough that we can camp inside the national parks. Not to mention resale value, which is always at the top of our list when purchasing any depreciating asset.🎬 YouTube Course https://howtostartayoutubechannel.com/ If you have ever thought about starting a YouTube channel or just want even better videos to document your journey, we share everything we've learned.

Lastly we'll finish on Etihad's three room apartment in the sky, known as The Residence. This not only has a living room, but a private ensuite bathroom and bedroom!As usual I paid for this trip myself, and due to the complexities of the routing, I was unable to use miles to redeem.

It was an insane financial commitment and huge leap of faith that it would be the boat of our dreams.  And ever since that day…we have been preparing for this one.  The day we would go on our first sail aboard CURIOSITY², our spankin’ new HH44. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------WE’RE JASON AND NIKKI WYNN.  A couple of modern-day documentarians, perpetual travelers, and seekers of tall tales.  We’ve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?  Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life.  It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown.  The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us.Our home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land.  Self-reliance and living a sustainable lifestyle are a must.  It's all about managing our resources and we’re always looking for new and better ways to do so.  We've lived off the grid for over 10 years now in everything from a Van to RV to a Sailboat.

Some of these characters will be based on characters of mine that I've already done, and some will be brand new. I am really invested in the idea, so I hope you guys enjoy. Last week, I focused on making the 2 part mold out of silicone and using casting material to create my base character that I will then sculpt onto with air dry clay.

I'm heavy into editing, so my video are chalk full of sound effects, filters and lil....moments, or as we like to call them MEmes. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and various other items I find. I also love to draw, traditionally and digitally. I'm not the most skilled artist out here, but I like to focus on having fun with creativity and being able to laugh at my own mistakes.

If you’re looking to build your credit without adding debt, check out the Experian Smart Money Debit Card and Digital Checking Account. In this episode, we quickly settle the debate on the better All-Pro award and decide to go ahead and rig the vote to get Travis a People’s Choice Award. Just go ahead and vote for Big Yeti below. https://www.votepca.com/pop-culture/the-athleteThen we get right into wildcard weekend with Travis recapping the coldest football game ever played at Arrowhead, revealing what lengths players went to to stay warm, and why Rashee Rice has suddenly been unstoppable. We then get to Jason and the Eagles coming up short in Tampa capping off a rough end of the season. Jason breaks down the reactions from the players in the locker room, what he was feeling on the sideline, and his thoughts on what happens next. The guys also go around the league to recap a wild first week of the playoffs including CJ Stroud pulling off the upset against the Browns, the Packers shocking the world in Dallas, Detroit winning its first playoff game in over 30 years, and the insanity that was the Bills snowy win over the Steelers. We also touch on some of the major coaching shakeups from around the league, get an update on how Jason feels about scented candles, and decide on the best Girl Scout Cookie thanks to a wonderful not dumb question. And for those of you looking to compete in our first-ever fan contest, we will be putting out the full Best Team Name bracket and link to enter later today. Follow us on social for details. We will be back Friday with a preview of the Chiefs Divisional games in Buffalo maybe the most terrifying Travis fan art we’ve ever seen and a full breakdown of the first round of our “Best Team Name” bracket challenge.
